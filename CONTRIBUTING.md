# How to contribute to Politeiagui

We are excited you want to contribute to Politeiagui. This is the best place to get you started!

If you haven't yet, please join our [Matrix Channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#politeia:decred.org) and 
introduce yourself. We always like to know who is interested in the project and we can help you with any questions you may have.


**Did you find a bug?**

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching our GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include:
    - a title and clear description
    - as much relevant information possible

- Evaluate if this bug wouldn't be better placed in the [Politeia] repository instead. Politeiagui issues are intentended to bugs which affects the UI directly. If the bug requires backend work, first create an issue on Politeia. If you are not sure where it belongs, feel free to ask us.

**Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Before openning an issue, suggest your change in the [Politeia Room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#politeia:decred.org) and collect enough positive feedback. We expect GitHub issues to be primarly intended for bug reports and fixes.

**Do you intend to work on a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Give a signal in the issue that you are going to work on it or assign the issue to your self if you have the GitHub permission.

- Do your best to drive the issue into completition. But if you think you won't be able to finish it, remember to comment in the issue signaling that you are no longer working on it.

- Do not allow more than 10 days without providing a status of your work, otherwise the issue will be free for others to take.

**Did you write a patch code that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the code.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable. 

**Do you intend to work an issue but you don't know what to pick?**

- **If you are newcomer**, look for the 'good-first-issue' label in the issues list. Those are the easiest ones to be dealt with.

- **If you are already contributing**, prioritize the issues by weightining the value it will deliver to the end user and how fast you can write that code. Generally speaking, the labels 'bug', 'ux', 'enhancements' are good choices. They are generally faster to be handled and they deliver a good value to the end user. 

- **If you are already contributing** and want to work on a more challenging issue, make sure to share your intention in the [Politeia Room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#politeia:decred.org) to check if the issue is still relevant and also gather some thoughts from other peers.
