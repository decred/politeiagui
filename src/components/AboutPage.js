    Decred is an autonomous digital currency. With a hybrid consensus system,
    it is built to be a decentralized, sustainable, and self-ruling currency
    where stakeholders make the rules.

    Politeia (Pi) is a censorship-resistant blockchain-anchored public proposal
    system, which empowers users to submit their own projects for self-funding
    from DCR's block subsidy. Pi ensures the ecosystem remains sustainable and
    thrives.
