# Identity

## About

Your public and private keys constitute your **Identity**. The private
key is used to sign your records, comments and any up/down votes on
Politeia. **You can have only one identity active at a time**.

Your keys are stored in your browser by default, so if you use Politeia on
multiple machines you will need to import your keys before you can participate.

## Create New Identity

Creating a new identity means **generating a new public and private keys pair**.
These keys will be stored on your browser by default.

Once you request a new identity, Politeia will send a verification link to your
e-mail to confirm this process.

## Activate your identity

Your new identity has been requested, please check your email to verify and
activate it. **The verification link needs to be open with the same browser that
you used to generate this new identity.**
