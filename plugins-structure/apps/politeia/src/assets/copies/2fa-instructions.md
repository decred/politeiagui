You can activate 2FA on your account by following the instructions below. Once
you activate 2FA on your account, **you'll be required to enter your code every
time you login**.

1. **Save** the backup key below. If you did not write down or copy this backup
   key during 2FA setup, there's no way for you to view it later.

2. **Scan** the QR Code with a TOTP Authenticator _(Authy, Google
   Authenticator, FreeOTP, YubiKey, etc)_

3. **Verify** the 6-numbers code given by the authenticator using the input
   below to activate the 2FA

You will be able to deactivate the 2FA after you setup the keys.
