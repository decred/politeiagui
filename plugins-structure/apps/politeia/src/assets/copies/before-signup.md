Politeia will send you a link to verify your email address. **You must open this
link in the same browser**.

After verifying your email, Politeia will create your “identity”, which consists
of a public/private cryptographic key pair and browser cookie. This is necessary
to verify your account and allow submission of proposals, commenting, voting,
and other Politeia functions. After completing the signup process, you can
export your identity keys to another browser at any time.
