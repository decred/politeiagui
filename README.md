# Politeia GUI

## Development

### Requirements
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### With mock APIs

    yarn && yarn uidev

### Against politeiawww

    yarn && yarn start

## Production

    yarn && yarn build
    ls build

## package.json

    The package.json file has the field "network" (testnet or mainnet),
    which we need in order to get the last block height.

    This way it is possible to determine when a vote has finished or not.

```bash

```

The container can then be run with
