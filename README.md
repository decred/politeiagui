# Politeia GUI

## Development

### Requirements
- node (only versions 4 to 9 works right now)
- yarn

### With mock APIs


    yarn && yarn uidev

### Against politeiawww

    yarn && yarn start

## Production

    yarn && yarn build
    ls build

## package.json

    The package.json file has the field "network" (testnet or mainnet),
    which we need in order to get the last block height.

    This way it is possible to determine when a vote has finished or not.

## Docker

`politeia` can be hosted in a docker container. To build the site and the docker container:

```bash

```

The container can then be run with
