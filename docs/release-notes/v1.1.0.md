politeiagui v1.1.0
====

This feature release includes the following feature additions as well as a
number of bug fixes and minor improvements.

- Require additional proposal metadata fields on proposal submission (amount,
  start date, estimated end date, and domain).

- Combine the "In Discussion" and "Voting" tabs into a single "Under Review"
  tab.

- Allow users to view the raw markdown of a record.

- Display additional metadata for censored and abandoned proposals such as the
  reason the proposal was censored and the admin that performed the action.

- Don't render markdown formatting in comments that changes the size of the
  comment text.

- Add a warning message to the markdown editor that recommends people draft
  the content offline.

- Render inline images in the markdown preview.

- Improve the flat mode toggle button UX.

Note: this release enables the blob directive on the Content-Security-Policy
header. This change must also be made in the nginx config. See
[2495](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2495) for details on the
change that needs to be made.
