politeiagui v1.0.0
====

This release of politeiagui corresponds to the politeia
[v1.0.0](https://github.com/decred/politeia/releases/tag/v1.0.0) release. It
introduces the politeiagui changes required to support the new politeia backend
and APIs.

## proposals-archive

The previous politeia instance has been archived and now resides at
[proposals-archive.decred.org](https://proposals-archive.decred.org). A large
amount of proposal data from these archived proposals has been hardcoded into
politeiagui so that they are still displayed in the proposal list views of
politeiagui. This hardcoding is a temporary measure and will be removed in a
future release once the archived proposals are no longer active.
