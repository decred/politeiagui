politeiagui v1.3.0
====

This release includes the following additions and improvements. See the
changelog for the full list of changes.

- **Proposal billing statuses.** Admins now have the ability to update the
  billing status of a proposal. Billing statuses include active, closed, and
  completed. This will allow Decred's contractor management system (CMS) to
  prevent billing against proposals that are no longer active and it will
  allow Politeia to categorize proposals by billing status. For example, a
  user will be able to view all proposals that are actively being billed
  against. This filtering has not been implemented yet, but will be in the
  future.

- **Proposal statuses.** Proposals now have a proposal status that maps out
  all possible paths a proposal can take during it's lifecycle. Examples of
  proposal statuses include under review, abandoned, approved, rejected,
  active, and completed. The status of proposal is displayed as a tag in the
  upper right hand corner of the proposal in both the list views and proposal
  details page.

- **SEO meta tags.** SEO meta tags were added to improve search engine results
 for Politeia. Politeia links posted to Twitter will now also include a link
 image (Twitter card).

- **Plugin testing infrastructure.** e2e testing infrastructure was added to
  allow e2e tests to be written for the composable plugin layer that is
  currently being worked on. It provides a scalable framework for mocking
  plugin test data and allows developers to create custom commands for testing
  plugin API.

- **Various UX improvements.**
  - The dark mode toggle switch was updated with some new light/dark mode
    graphics.
  - Various bugs and UX issues related to comment thread navigation were fixed.
  - Anytime a proposal is censored or abandoned, the username of the admin who
    made the status change and the reason they gave for the status change are
    now display on the proposal details page.
  - The error message for user identity errors was improved. It tells the user
    how to fix the error and provides a link to their user details page to
    do so.
  - The date display format was change from "MM/DD/YYYY" to the more human
    readable "Day Month Year". For example, 11/15/2021 will now be displayed
    as 15 Nov 2021.
