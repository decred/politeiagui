politeiagui v1.2.0
====

This release includes the following feature additions, bug fixes and improvements:

- **Optimistic comment vote updates** Comment votes now do an optimistic update
in order to improve UX. The vote is rewinded if any server error is returned
after the server request is complete.

- **View all versions on proposal diff viewer** Before this feature, a user
could only compare the selected version against its previous one. This makes
it possible to select any versions on the diff viewer.

- **Proposal author updates** Proposal authors are now able to give periodic
updates on the status of their proposal. With this feature, once the proposal
is approved, the author will be able to open new comment threads to provide
updates for the community.

- **Improve embed image button UX** The embed image button now opens an upload
image modal. When the user selects the image, the url will be inserted to the
markdown text at the current location of the cursor.
