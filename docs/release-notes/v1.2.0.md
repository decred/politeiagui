politeiagui v1.2.0
====

This release includes the following feature additions, bug fixes and
improvements:

- **Proposal author updates ([#2549](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2549)).**
  Proposal authors are now able to give updates on the status of their
  proposal. Updates take the form of new comment threads. Each update creates a
  new comment section in politeiagui that users are able to interact with. The
  proposal author can give as many updates as they would like. Only one update
  thread is allowed to be active at a time. When an author creates a new update
  thread, the previous update thread is locked.

- **Select diff viewer versions ([#2524](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2524)).**
  This feature makes it possible to show the diff between any two versions of a
  record. Previously, a user could only use the diff viewer to compare a record
  version with its previous version, e.g. if you wanted to see the diff for
  version 3, it would show the diff between version 3 and version 2. 

- **Embed image button ([#2567](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2567)).**
  An embed image button has been added to allow a user to insert an image into
  the proposal markdown file. Previously, the only way to do this was to drag
  and drop the image into the markdown editor at the desired location.

- **Optimistic comment vote updates ([#2520](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/2520)).**
  Comment votes are now executed optimistically in order to improve the comment
  vote UX. Previously, the vote would not be displayed in the UI until the
  server returned a successful response, creating a delay between when the user
  clicks the upvote/downvote button and when the vote is displayed by the UI of
  the user casting the comment vote. The UI will now display the vote
  immediately on click of the upvote/downvote button, then rewinds the vote if
  the server returns an error.

**Note:** the politeia v1.2.0 release includes additional features like
proposal billing statuses and proposal statuses. These have not been
implemented in politeiagui yet.
